Project 4
Application is called "Our Online Tests". It allows admins to create and manage tests online.

Features:
- Login/Logout/Create account
- Allows admin user to create a test, and assign
- Allows test taker to log in and take a test
- Admin can upload "test takers" which creates account that tests can be assigned to
- 4 question types are multiple choice, choose one, true/false, essay question (all essay questions are graded as correct)
- Assigned tests appear on main page
- User can view test history only for their user, admin can see for all users in the account

Javascript and JQuery are being used in the following areas:
- Editing tests to enable tabs and to update test questions
- While taking tests to operate the timer and enforce timeouts
- On all input pages for form validation

Information for graders:
- If you login using the account demo@admin.com with PWD = testit, you can see a few tests that I created and how the tests look when assigned.
- If you create a new account the account user is an admin and all uploaded "test takers" are not admins. You will see a different menu depending on who you log in as
- If you want to test the test taker upload , there is a file called test_emps.txt in the root you can upload to add two new users
